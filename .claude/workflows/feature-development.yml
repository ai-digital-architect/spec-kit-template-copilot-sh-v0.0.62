steps:
  - step: 1
    name: "Requirements Analysis"
    prompt: |
      Let's analyze the feature requirements. I'll help you:
      1. Clarify the feature scope
      2. Identify affected components
      3. List technical requirements
      4. Note potential challenges
    outputs:
      - requirements_doc
      - component_list
      - technical_considerations
      
  - step: 2
    name: "Design & Architecture"
    prompt: |
      Now let's design the solution:
      1. Component structure
      2. Data models needed
      3. API endpoints required
      4. State management approach

      - "skills/project/architecture"
    outputs:
      - design_document
      - file_structure
      
  - step: 3
    name: "Implementation Planning"
    prompt: |
      Let's break down the implementation:
      1. Create task list
      2. Estimate complexity
      3. Identify dependencies
      4. Plan testing strategy
    outputs:
      - task_list
      - testing_plan
      
  - step: 4
    name: "Code Generation"
    prompt: |
      I'll help generate the code for each component.
      Should I start with:
      - Database models
      - API routes
      - Services
      - UI components
    interactive: true
    
  - step: 5
    name: "Testing & Documentation"
    prompt: |
      Let's create tests and documentation:
      1. Unit tests
      2. Integration tests
      3. API documentation
      4. Component documentation
    outputs:
      - test_files
      - documentation
