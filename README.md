## Project Name and Description

SpecKit Template for Copilot (v0.0.62) provides a structured, reproducible workflow for building features via Spec‑Driven Development. It standardizes how specs become plans, tasks, and implementations, with quality gates enforced by a project constitution and helpful prompts for AI agents and humans alike.

> [!TIP]
> For agent‑specific guidance, see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. For cross‑agent coordination, see `AGENTS.md`.

## Technology Stack

- Bash scripts for workflow automation (`.specify/scripts/bash/*`)
- VS Code Chat prompts for each phase (`.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`)
- Git feature branching with enforced naming (`NNN-feature-name`)
- Optional DDD assets and templates (`.specify/ddd`, `.specify/templates/ddd/*`)
- Cross‑platform: macOS/Linux with standard shell tooling

## Project Architecture

High‑level Spec‑Driven flow:

1. Create/Update spec → `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
2. Plan → `specs/<feature>/plan.md` (+ `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`)
3. Tasks → `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` organized by user stories
4. Implement → execute tasks by phases; verify ignore files

Key directories:

```
.github/
  prompts/            # Phase prompts (specify, plan, tasks, implement, analyze)
.specify/
  scripts/bash/       # Core scripts (setup-plan.sh, check-prerequisites.sh, ...)
  templates/          # Plan/spec/tasks templates + DDD templates
  ddd/                # DDD helpers and examples
.vscode/settings.json # Auto‑approves running scripts in chat
specs/                # Feature folders created by the flow (when features exist)
```

## Getting Started

- Prerequisites: Git, Bash (macOS/Linux), and VS Code (for chat prompts)
- Clone the repository and open it in VS Code
- Use chat commands to run the workflow:
  - `/speckit.specify` → create/update feature spec and branch
  - `/speckit.plan` → create `plan.md` from template; generate design artifacts
  - `/speckit.tasks` → generate `tasks.md` organized by user stories
  - `/speckit.implement` → execute tasks by phases; manage ignore files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Branch naming is enforced. Use `NNN-feature-name` (e.g., `001-user-login`). In non‑git contexts, set `SPECIFY_FEATURE=<feature-folder>`.

## Project Structure

- `.github/prompts/` — authoritative behavior for each phase
- `.specify/scripts/bash/` — scripts invoked by prompts (JSON outputs, validations)
- `.specify/templates/` — templates for plan/spec/tasks and DDD assets
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — project constitution (quality gates and MUSTs)
- `specs/<feature>/` — per‑feature docs generated by the flow (created when you run the commands)

## Key Features

- Spec‑driven lifecycle with clear artifacts at each phase
- Constitution‑backed quality gates integrated into planning
- Tasks organized by user story with optional `[P]` markers for parallel work
- DDD support via helpers and templates
- Agent context updater to keep AI guidance in sync with plans

## Development Workflow

- Branching: `NNN-feature-name` enforced by scripts (see `.specify/scripts/bash/common.sh`)
- Command sequence:
  1. `/speckit.specify`
  2. `/speckit.plan`
  3. `/speckit.tasks`
  4. `/speckit.implement`
- Analyze anytime with `/speckit.analyze` (read‑only) to check consistency, coverage, and constitution alignment

## Coding Standards

- Documentation: follow `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md` (H2/H3 headings, YAML front matter, fenced code blocks, line length)
- Workflow:
  - Use absolute paths when invoking scripts; escape single quotes in args (`I'\''m Groot`)
  - Resolve “NEEDS CLARIFICATION” in `plan.md` during Phase 0 research
  - Preserve template heading order; remove placeholders only when templates instruct

## Testing

- Tests are optional and generated only when requested in specs; tasks may include TDD ordering when applicable
- Checklists (if present under a feature) should be completed before implementation or explicitly approved to proceed
- Implementation phase verifies ignore files based on actual tech stack (Node, Python, Java, etc.)
